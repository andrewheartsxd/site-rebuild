### Site Rebuild

> I have written a very dumbed down version of the dappered.com homepage. I have the header, the navigation bar, the latest posts section, two of the sidebars, and the footer. When put into the outliner, these all show up as individual sections.

I got the proper element tags to use from the slide deck (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WoCxqf6fkZ59GdzU97CBDS7XhjG-MSDYL0MegsbzHpk/edit#slide=id.p) as well as by inspecting the page elements in Chrome.

I am still unsure whether the "Latest Posts" should be an article or section (or both?)
